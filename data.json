By 1645 he acquired land in Virginia, although he continued as a ship captain and died in England. John Flower (b.1624) and Jacob Flower (b.1635), two sons of John Flower II, emigrated in 1656 from England to the land purchased by their father in what is now Surry County, Virginia. Descendants (chiefly spelling the surname Flowers) and relatives lived in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Texas and elsewhere. Includes some ancestral records and genealogical data in England to ca. 1542.",
